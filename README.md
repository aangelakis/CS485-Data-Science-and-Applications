# CS-485: Data Science and Applications ‚Äì Homework Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks completed for the CS-485 course (Data Science and Applications). Each notebook tackles a specific machine learning or data analysis topic, implementing both theoretical and practical aspects.

## üìÇ Notebooks Overview

### 1. `PCA_and_Linear_Regression.ipynb`
Performs dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), followed by linear regression modeling to understand and predict data patterns.

### 2. `Gaussian_Mixture_Models.ipynb`
Explores clustering with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), focusing on probabilistic modeling and expectation-maximization (EM) for unsupervised learning tasks.

### 3. `Data_Normalization_Preprocessing_SVM.ipynb`
Covers preprocessing techniques like normalization and feature scaling. Also includes classification using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for structured datasets.

### 4. `Multilayer_Perceptrons.ipynb`
Implements a feedforward neural network (MLP) from scratch and/or using deep learning frameworks. Investigates activation functions, training performance, and overfitting.

### 5. `CNNs_Fashion_MNIST.ipynb`
Trains and evaluates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the Fashion-MNIST dataset for image classification tasks, highlighting deep learning pipelines.

### 6. `ADF_Analysis.ipynb`
Applies the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to assess stationarity in time series data. Includes visualizations and insights for preprocessing time series.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (depending on notebook)
- Statsmodels (for ADF analysis)
